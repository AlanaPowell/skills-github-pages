# Welcome

Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder with a background in environmental science and a passion for applying computational methods to climate research.

---

## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (expected May 2026) while building on my foundation in Environmental Science from Florida State University. My experience spans from marine field research with shark species in the Gulf of Mexico to current environmental consulting work at TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering.
Technical Skills:

Programming: Python, R, C++, MATLAB
Data Analysis: Statistical modeling, GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS)
Visualization: PowerBI, Tableau, scientific plotting
Laboratory: FTIR spectroscopy, soil analysis, marine specimen characterization

Current Role: Environmental Scientist at TerraGraphics Environmental Engineering, where I perform research, data engineering, and manage multivariable datasets for environmental projects.

Current Project: Interactive Climate Data Dashboard
Last updated: 6/5/2025

## Project Proposal 
Vision statement
This project aims to enhance my professional skill set by strengthening my knowledge and experience with data analysis, programming, and scientific visualization skills using Python. 

---

### Motivation
I see this project as an opportunity to gain experience that I need to succeed in my future career. I have a background in environmental science and am a current computer science student, with a desire to bridge that gap to become a climate scientist. I need experience to do that and this project offers me the chance to create that for myself. 

---

### Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project
My learning objectives for this project are: 

To familiarize myself with and implement to some capacity the recommended python libraries used often in the field of climate science, such as: 	

xarray - handles climate data files 
pandas - data manipulation
plotly - interactive charts
streamlit - turns your Python code into a web app

Process and analyze a dataset, either one found online through NOAA or one given to me by my advisor

  Create data visualizations using python libraries 
  Additional goals: To research roadmaps for possible careers, like grad school or potential future employers with interest in the skills I’m developing in this project. 

---

### Risks to project completion
Using unfamiliar libraries in Python 
Limited time/time management 
Data availability/access: Potential issues with dataset downloads or formats


Mitigation strategy for the risks listed above
I plan to create a weekly schedule with a list of goals and objectives to keep myself on track and work towards. 
---
### Project assessments 
By the end of Summer, I will have at least one project underway with a research group in my field using the tools/skills developed in this project. And if time permits to complete my optional goal, I will also have a better idea of my post-graduation goals thought through – be it PhD programs or potential organizations to apply to.

Dataset(s) fully processed and analyzed
Visualizations created and interpreted

### Weekly Progress Updates
This section will be updated weekly with project developments, challenges, and learnings.
